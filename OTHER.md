Progress
========

This is a sort of progress report on my part in getting the i2p browser into
Whonix:

tb-updater
----------

Whonix has a useful helper script which makes sure you have an up-to-date Tor
Browser in a package called tb-updater. The script(/usr/bin/update-torbrowser)
checks for the presence of a current Tor browser at $HOME/.tb/tor-browser, and
downloads it if one is not present. It can do this on Whonix and non-Whonix
distributions. This script was simple to modify to add an --i2p flag, which does
exactly the same procedure to download a Tor Browser Bundle(unmodified) to the
$HOME/.i2pb/i2p-browser path.

The changes I made can be viewed [here:](https://github.com/eyedeekay/tb-updater/compare)

You can test it by installing with 'make install' or using the package manager
by cloning my fork and running

        tar -czvf ../tb-updater_6.2.orig.tar.gz .
        debuild -us -uc

from the cloned repo directory. Once installed, you can download an i2p browser
by running torbrowser-updater with the new **--i2p** flag. As of June 10th, 2018
this change has been submitted to https://github.com/Whonix/tb-updater by a pull
request. As of June 12th, 2018 the tb-updater script modified for i2p has been
included in tb-updater.

tb-starter
----------

Whonix has another very useful helper script for launching a Tor Browser Bundle
safely in a package called tb-starter. It solves quite a few relevant problems
with distributing a browser like the Tor Browser Bundle on an operating system
with policies like Debian and an architecture like Whonix. It's actually a
really convenient way of running Tor Browser on vanilla Debian too, but YMMV.
tb-starter detects things about the system and configures Tor Browser using
environment variables(As opposed to the preference-setting here). If the helper
script(/usr/bin/torbrowser) doesn't find a Tor Browser Bundle at
$HOME/.tb/tor-browser, then it will invoke tb-updater.

The changes I made can be viewed [here:](https://github.com/eyedeekay/tb-starter/compare)

You can test it by installing with 'make install' or using the package manager
by running

        tar -czvf ../tb-starter_3.2.orig.tar.gz .
        debuild -us -uc

from the cloned repo directory. Once installed, you'll have a helper script
at /usr/bin/i2pbrowser which will launch your pre-configured Tor Browser for
i2p, hereafter called i2p browser. The behavior of this is still being refined.
It will be ready to submit before the Torbutton patch, and will be submitted as
soon as the Torbutton patch clears.

torbutton
---------

Most of the environment variables set by tb-starter pertain to Torbutton.
Unfortunately, there was no environment variable for
extensions.torbutton.use\_nontor\_proxy and there was no environment variable
for setting the HTTP proxy(And i2p's SOCKS proxy isn't used for web-browsing
under normal circumstances). In order to fix the SOCKS proxy issue in a way that
did not complicate the Tor Browser itself and which accounted for a future where
the Tor Browser Bundle communicates via a Unix socket instead of a SOCKS proxy,
I chose to use the TOR\_SOCKS\_IPC\_PATH environment variable to direct the
i2p browser to communicate with
/var/run/i2p-torbrowser-sockets-workaround/i2p\_127.0.0.1\_4447.sock.
Unfortunately, this wasn't sufficient, even with the existing environment
variables, to allow the Tor Browser to communicate over i2p. In order to do
that, I neeeded to set extensions.torbutton.use\_nontor\_proxy=true, which means
adding an environment variable to configure Torbutton.

In order to do that, I made the change shown in [this commit](https://github.com/eyedeekay/torbutton/commit/3879775737a640a78e4cbe99605ac22d7b201a0a).

In order to test it, you'll need to close my fork of Torbutton and run the

        ./makexpi.sh

from the cloned repo director. Then you'll need to start the i2p browser and go
to about:config, where you'll need to disable xpiinstall.signatures. Then you
can install the add-on from the newly generated .xpi file. You may need re-start
the browser for the changes to take effect. As of June 10th, 2018, this change
has been [submitted as a trac ticket to the Tor Project](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/26341).

i2p-torbrowser-sockets-workaround
---------------------------------

Since Tor Browser Bundle needs to communicate over a Unix socket, and since i2p
does not provide one by default, I needed to provide one. For testing, I simply
did this with socat, roughly thus:

        socat -t600 -x -v UNIX-LISTEN:"/var/run/i2p-torbrowser-sockets-workaround/i2p_127.0.0.1_4444.sock",mode=777,reuseaddr,fork TCP-CONNECT:localhost:4444

However to start these automatically, and direct them to a guest, it would be
better to have them managed by the system/services. So that's what this repo
is for. It's barely tested, as I'm usually travelling and my netbook doesn't
have the horsepower to support a Qubes or Whonix-based setup.

As far as I can reckon, once I have this finished some semblance of support for
i2p browsing in Whonix [will be within reach.](https://github.com/eyedeekay/i2p-torbrowser-sockets-workaround)
